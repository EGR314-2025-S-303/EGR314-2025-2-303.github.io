## Goal of Exhibit 

The goal of the exhibit is to create interactive, engaging, and educational experiences tailored to Kindergarten through 12th-grade students. Using interactive features, the exhibit aims to foster curiosity and active exploration by encouraging students to engage directly with scientific, cultural, or artistic concepts. By incorporating age-appropriate, hands-on activities, the exhibit seeks to make learning enjoyable and memorable while addressing key educational objectives such as understanding cause-and-effect relationships, correcting misconceptions, and sparking interest in the subject matter. The primary focus is on ensuring that students can interact with the exhibit in meaningful ways, promoting discovery and conceptual understanding through well-designed, intuitive, and durable interactive elements.



## Who is our Audience?

The audience for the exhibit is Kindergarten through 12th-grade students, representing a wide range of developmental stages, interests, and learning styles. The exhibit is designed to cater to this diverse group by providing engaging, hands-on activities that are accessible and educational for younger children while still challenging and thought-provoking for older students. It considers the physical, cognitive, and social needs of the audience, ensuring the content is age-appropriate, visually appealing, and interactive. Additionally, the design emphasizes inclusivity, accommodating students with varying abilities and encouraging group interactions to reflect the collaborative nature of learning at this age.

## Concept Sketch
import pdf file here 

Describe, in one page (in word, single spaced, 12pt times new roman font),
How the features highlighted in your concept sketch satisfy the needs of museum visitors.
How the functionality will will be split across four teammates (See the project description)
Internet-based two-way communication
Human machine interface via a screen and buttons
Sensor and Actuator-based controlled response
In this passage, please also use the two readings on science exhibits to justify how your concept satisfies the following questions:
What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?
How do you plan on designing your "controls" (see page 4 and 6 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")
What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience?
What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device? (see page 5 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")
